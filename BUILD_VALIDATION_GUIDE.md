# Build Validation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to validate that all library updates have been successfully applied and the project builds correctly with the latest stable versions.

## Pre-Build Checklist

### âœ… Updates Completed
All the following updates have been successfully applied to the project:

- **Android Gradle Plugin**: Updated to 8.7.0 (latest stable)
- **Gradle Wrapper**: Updated to 8.10.2 (latest stable)
- **Kotlin**: Updated to 2.0.20 (major version upgrade)
- **Jetpack Compose BOM**: Updated to 2025.08.00 (Compose 1.9)
- **Hilt**: Updated to 2.57.1 with KSP support
- **Android API Level**: Updated to 35 (Android 15 support)
- **Java Version**: Upgraded to Java 11
- **All Dependencies**: Updated to latest stable versions

### âœ… Migration Completed
- **KAPT to KSP Migration**: Successfully migrated Hilt from KAPT to KSP for faster builds
- **Build Configuration**: Updated to support new versions and compatibility requirements

## Build Validation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Verification
Before building, ensure your development environment meets the updated requirements:

```bash
# Check Java version (should be 11 or higher)
java -version

# Check Android SDK (should include API 35)
# In Android Studio: Tools â†’ SDK Manager â†’ Check Android 15 (API 35) is installed
```

### Step 2: Clean Build
Start with a clean build to ensure no cached artifacts interfere:

```bash
cd DogBreedQuizApp
./gradlew clean
```

### Step 3: Dependency Resolution
Download and resolve all updated dependencies:

```bash
./gradlew dependencies --refresh-dependencies
```

### Step 4: Compilation Check
Compile the project to check for any compilation errors:

```bash
./gradlew compileDebugKotlin
```

### Step 5: Full Build
Perform a complete build including all tasks:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Step 6: Run Tests
Execute the test suite to ensure no regressions:

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Expected Build Performance Improvements

With the updates applied, you should observe:

### âš¡ Faster Build Times
- **KSP vs KAPT**: Up to 2x faster annotation processing for Hilt
- **Kotlin 2.0**: Improved K2 compiler performance
- **Gradle 8.10.2**: Enhanced build caching and parallel execution

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Features
- **Compose 1.9**: New UI components and performance improvements
- **Android 15 Support**: Latest Android features and APIs
- **Modern Toolchain**: Better IDE support and debugging capabilities

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Gradle Daemon Issues
If you encounter Gradle daemon problems:

```bash
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew clean build
```

### Issue 2: Dependency Resolution Conflicts
If there are dependency conflicts:

```bash
./gradlew dependencies --configuration debugRuntimeClasspath
# Review the dependency tree for conflicts
```

### Issue 3: KSP Processing Errors
If KSP annotation processing fails:

1. Ensure all Hilt annotations are correct
2. Check that KSP plugin is properly applied
3. Verify Hilt version compatibility

### Issue 4: Compose Compilation Errors
If Compose compilation fails:

1. Check Compose BOM version is correctly applied
2. Verify Kotlin Compose plugin version matches Kotlin version
3. Ensure all Compose dependencies use BOM versions

### Issue 5: API Level Compatibility
If there are API level issues:

1. Verify Android SDK 35 is installed
2. Check that all dependencies support API 35
3. Review any deprecated API usage

## Validation Checklist

After successful build, verify the following:

### âœ… Build Success
- [ ] Project compiles without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No dependency resolution conflicts
- [ ] Build completes in reasonable time

### âœ… Functionality Verification
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] All screens render correctly
- [ ] Navigation works properly
- [ ] API integration functions (dog.ceo API)
- [ ] Hilt dependency injection works
- [ ] Animations and UI interactions work

### âœ… Performance Validation
- [ ] Build time is improved (especially with KSP)
- [ ] App startup time is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No performance regressions

## Next Steps After Validation

### 1. Update Development Environment
Ensure all team members update their environments:
- Android Studio to latest version
- Android SDK to include API 35
- Java 11 or higher

### 2. Update CI/CD Pipeline
Update your continuous integration setup:
- Use Java 11 in build agents
- Update Android SDK in CI environment
- Adjust build timeouts (may be faster with KSP)

### 3. Monitor Performance
Track the performance improvements:
- Build time metrics
- App performance benchmarks
- Memory usage patterns

### 4. Documentation Updates
Update project documentation:
- Development setup instructions
- Build requirements
- Dependency management guidelines

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after the update:

### Immediate Rollback
If you need to quickly rollback to previous versions:

1. **Revert build.gradle files** to previous versions
2. **Restore Gradle wrapper** to previous version
3. **Switch back to KAPT** if KSP causes issues
4. **Downgrade API levels** if compatibility issues arise

### Selective Rollback
For specific library issues:

1. **Identify problematic dependency**
2. **Revert only that dependency** to previous version
3. **Test incrementally** to isolate issues
4. **Document workarounds** for future reference
